# What is this?
This is a set of playing cards that I imagine to be designed by a hypothetical group of people who only speak toki pona.

# What cards are there?
There are 35 unique lipu kute ("color cards") consisting of 7 sitelen (symbols, all of which are animals, and none of which have values) in 5 kute (colors, which act as the suits). Additionally, there are 5 unique lipu lawa ("controlling cards"), each of which has a command or action (though not every game will use them like that). 

# What does a deck consist of?
A kulupu lipu ("full deck") consists of two of each lipu kute and four of each lipu lawa for a total of 90 cards, though some games may have you split the deck to create a kulupu lipu kipisi ("half deck") consisting of 45 cards.

# What games can I play with it?
Make some up! This is a new frontier for games. Have fun!
